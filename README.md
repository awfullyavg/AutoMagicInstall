# AutoMagicInstall
This program was intended to help automate the installation of software located on a local server.
As such with most of my programs they are meant to help IT professionals with mundane tasks. 
In my current situation we don't have an MDM that allows me to push software installs discretly. 
Onboarding being on of the few tasks that I have to do a lot, I decided to make a tool that would help me install these softwares "AutoMagically".
Hope this can help other IT pros out there that are looking for a solution!

As always, I welcome any feedback!
